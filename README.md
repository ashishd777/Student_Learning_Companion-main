# Student_Learning_Companion
This is my project created under the course "Internet and Web Programming".

We are one and a half years into this pandemic which turned the world upside down. Isolation, quarantine and social distancing guidelines and mandates have caused schools and universities to be closed for months, forcing students into virtual classes. However, video software are only one component of holistic online education. Other auxiliary services such as note taking and options for various assessments are equally important to successfully transition into fully
virtual classes.
Our project will create a website to help students connect with their teachers from their homes. They will be able to register and then securely log into their accounts to enter the system as verified students. On logging in, they will have access to variousfacilities such astaking lecture notes which will be stored for future reference and creating their own schedule. Teachers will similarly also be able to log into their official accounts with their credentials to perform faculty functions such as assigning assignments, homework and creating student groups. The website administrator will be responsible for the overall maintenance and functioning of
the website.
